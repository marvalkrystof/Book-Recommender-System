                  "Deadly germs sprayed in shopping malls, bomb-lets spewing anthrax spores over battlefields, tiny vials of plague scattered in Times Square -- these are the poor man's hydrogen bombs, hideous weapons of mass destruction that can be made in a simple laboratory. In this groundbreaking work of investigative journalism, Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg, and William Broad of The New York Times uncover the truth about biological weapons and show why bio-warfare and bio-terrorism are fast becoming our worst national nightmare.  Among the startling revelations in Germs:   How the CIA secretly built and tested a model of a Soviet-designed germ bomb, alarming some officials who felt the work pushed to the limits of what is permitted by the global treaty banning germ arms. How the Pentagon embarked on a secret effort to make a superbug. Details about the Soviet Union's massive hidden program to produce biological weapons, including new charges that germs were tested on humans. How Moscow's scientists made an untraceable germ that instructs the body to destroy itself. The Pentagon's chaotic efforts to improvise defenses against Iraq's biological weapons during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. How a religious cult in Oregon in the 1980s sickened hundreds of Americans in a bio-terrorism attack that the government played down to avoid panic and copycat strikes. Plans by the U.S. military in the 1960s to attack Cuba with germ weapons.   Germs also shows how a small group of scientists and senior officials persuaded President Bill Clinton to launch a controversial multibillion-dollar program to detect a germ attack on U.S. soil and to aid its victims -- a program that, so far, is struggling to provide real protection.  Based on hundreds of interviews with scientists and senior officials, including President Clinton, as well as on recently declassified documents and on-site reporting from the former Soviet Union's sinister bio-weapons labs, Germs shows us bio-warriors past and present at work at their trade. There is the American scientist who devoted his professional life to perfecting biological weapons, and the Nobel laureate who helped pioneer the new biology of genetically modified germs and is now trying to stop its misuse. We meet former Soviet scientists who made enough plague, smallpox, and anthrax to kill everyone on Earth and whose expertise is now in great demand by terrorists, rogue states, and legitimate research labs alike.  A frightening and unforgettable narrative of cutting-edge science and spycraft, Germs shows us why advances in biology and the spread of germ weapons expertise to such countries as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea could make germs the weapon of the twenty-first century.",

It is the story of Bragg's father, a hard-drinking man with a murderous temper and the habit of running out on the people who needed him most.But at the center of this soaring memoir is Bragg's mother, who went eighteen years without a new dress so that her sons could have school clothes and picked other people's cotton so that her children wouldn't have to live on welfare alone. Evoking these lives--and the country that shaped and nourished them--with artistry, honesty, and compassion, Rick Bragg brings home the love and suffering that lie at the heart of every family.

                  "As a top aide to powerful Texas Congressman Ronald Coleman, John Jackley watched the nation's highest elected officials lie, manipulate media images, and spend millions of taxpayer dollars to stay in power. The mind-boggling scope of the abuse of perks and privilege by both legislators and their staffers finally shocked him into reality.What began as a secret journal for his children to clear his conscience has become Hill Rat, a journey behind Congress' closed doors and into the corrupt back alleys of power. With both humor and outrage, Jackley reveals how the promise of Congress has been hijacked and corrupted by the current crop of careerist incumbents. \"Today,\" he writes, \"a successful congressman has the fundraising ability of a hooker trying to make cab fare home and the morals of a big-time football coach!\"His account is laced with the names of Capitol Hill's most prominent legislators--Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, Speaker of the House Thomas Foley, Ron Dellums, Bill Alexander, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, Thomas Luken, and scores of others. Jackley also reveals, with names, dates, and examples, the outrageous power of Congressional staffers--\"Hill Rats\"--who \"run the engines of democracy on a daily basis and pride themselves on their ability to do anything in the name of their cause.\"To show the flagrant abuse of taxpayers' money for re-election purposes, Jackley points out that in just forty-eight hours in early 1992, the House mailed more than 58 million newsletters and postcards. In 1990, the first post-Jim Wright, post-congressional scandal election, 96% of the incumbents who ran were reelected. Even in 1988, only six Members running for re-election were defeated, a turnover rate less than that of the Soviet Politburo.From previously untold Congressional involvement in Oliver North's contra re-supply network to Democratic complicity in the S&L crisis to the taxpayer-funded incumbent protection plan, Hill Rat reveals secrets backed by hard evidence that will shake the House and shock the nation.",

                  "It was a wonderful summer, a great memory, the kind of love everybody ought to have. It changed my life - or almost did - and I think about it more than I should, but that was a long time ago.Amid the breathtaking beauty of the Catskill Mountains, Avrum Feldman listened to the haunting voice of Amelita Galli-Curci ringing over the Shandaken Valley - a voice no one else could hear. When he died at age one hundred six, his obsession for the famous opera diva had lasted three-quarters of a century. Most people considered Avrum crazy, someone preoccupied with romantic nonsense. But Madison Lee \"Bobo\" Murphy was not among them, for he, too, had a love that changed his life, or almost did: Amy Lourie.In the summer of 1955, Bobo was a waiter at the Catskill's Pine Hill Inn; a rural Southerner who had never heard the word meshugge until Avrum - a retired furrier, teacher, and translator from New York City - became his unlikely friend. For Bobo nothing about that summer ever lost its glow: his first taste of kartoffel suppe; the exotic mingling of Yiddish and German in the dining room; the girl he met and loved....In everyone's life, Avrum had instructed, there is one grand, undeniable moment of change that never stops mattering. It came for Bobo in his first meeting with Amy, the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. He was too naive to comprehend the gulf between their worlds, and she was too smitten by him to care. But for a wealthy Jewish girl and a Georgia farm boy, the summer had to end, leaving Bobo to learn the painful lesson of loving someone and believing you cannot be with them.Now, thirty-eight years later, Avrum is gone, leaving a will that beckons Bobo north to the Catskills once more. In the places he'd walked so often on the paths of memory, he embraces the ghosts of old friendships and the haunting hints of Amy's presence, until she unexpectedly appears. Nothing has dimmed the passion of their youth, yet two lifetimes and a thousand Catskills sunsets stand between who they were and who they have become. The strikes against them are different now, but mysteriously, miraculously, as Bobo carries out Avrum's last wishes for a strange Kaddish, he hears the dreams of his youth, of the young man who went forth and became part of a love larger than himself....",

                  "For the first time ever, veteran World War II cryptographer Hervie Haufler details how American and British codebreakers were the decisive factor in the Allied victory. From the Purple Machine to the Navajo Talkers to the breaking of Japan's JN-25 Naval Code to the shadowy world of decoding units like Hut-8 in Bletchley Park, he shows how crucial information-often obtained by surreptitious and violent means-was the decisive edge in the Battle of Britain, at Midway and against the U-Boats in the North Atlantic, and how Allied intelligence saved the Soviet Union from almost certain defeat.  In an accessible account based on years of research, interviews and exclusive access to previously top-secret archives, Haufler demonstrates how cryptography enabled Nimitz and MacArthur to persevere in the Pacific and helped Eisenhower and Patton mount the assaults on Normandy. In compelling detail, Haufler shows us how it was done-as only one who was on the frontlines of the \"secret war\" could tell it.",

Melisma, they call it.Living a melismatic life in imitation of plainchant, we may stop on an experience, a place, a person, or a memory and rhapsodize in imagination. Some like to meditate or contemplate melismatically, while others prefer to draw, build, paint, or dance whatever their eye has fallen upon.Living one point after another, is one form of experience, and it can be emphatically productive. But stopping for melisma gives the soul its reason for being.",

How Good Do We Have to Be? is for everyone who experiences that sense of guilt and disappointment. Harold Kushner, writing with his customary generosity and wisdom, shows us how human life is too complex for anyone to live it without making mistakes, and why we need not fear the loss of God's love when we are less than perfect. Harold Kushner begins by offering a radically new interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve, which he sees as a tale of Paradise Outgrown rather than Paradise Lost: eating from the Tree of Knowledge was not an act of disobedience, but a brave step forward toward becoming human, complete with the richness of work, sexuality and child-rearing, and a sense of our mortality. Drawing on modern literature, psychology, theology,,and his own thirty years of experience as a congregational rabbi, Harold Kushner reveals how acceptance and forgiveness can change our relationships with the most important people in our lives and help us meet the bold and rewarding challenge of being human.",

A mix of memoir, fiction, invented memoir, and fiction that rings with the truth, Love Love and Love charts the state of romance, sex, and relationships - the need to love and be loved - in several cities, and several sexes, around the world. The same biting wit, fragile irony, and arresting candor of Sandra's performances are all here, but Love Love and Love is also filled with an intimacy and an insight that are all new... and all Bernhard.Here are the stories of a relationship built on the weapon of romance; of an elusive girl, and the various drugs she gives and takes; of dreams and daydreams that melt into truth; of the touch of a lover's skin at the break of dawn; and of all the pain and cruelty that go along so well with the ecstasy we all want to possess. This is a book about relationships born of chance meetings on the street at night; about sexual obsessions, frayed emotions, and haunting memories of both the quick and the dead. Love Love and Love is by turns shocking and exhilarating, angry and passionate, analytical and sexy; it's all about that strange state of being that merges sensations only of the moment with an emotion that has existed since the birth of humankind.As Sandra herself notes: \"Love is the only shocking act left on the face of the earth.\"",

                  "By Goldman, Kevin",
                  "On December 16, 1994, a bloodletting took place in the stylish sixth-floor boardroom at Saatchi & Saatchi Company PLC, once the world's largest advertising agency holding company. Maurice Saatchi, the 48 year-old chairman who co-founded the company in 1970 with his older brother Charles, was fired by the board of directors under threat by the firm's largest shareholders. Less than a month later, Maurice started a rival ad agency and quickly snapped up former Saatchi & Saatchi clients, most importantly British Airways. Kevin Goldman, the former daily advertising columnist for the Wall Street Journal, spoke to everyone connected with this headline-making saga -- including Maurice Saatchi and his reclusive brother Charles -- and witnessed important business meetings, including Maurice Saatchi's winning pitch to British Airways. Goldman traces every step the Saatchi brothers took, from their youth as Iraqi Jewish immigrants in North London to their business merger in 1970, when, with little more than sheer audacity, the opened an ad agency with a full-page announcement ad in the London Sunday Times. Through bold and brash actions, the agency began an acquisitions binge, taking over many of the ad industry's giants -- including Ted Bates, Backer & Spielvogel, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, and Garland-Compton -- to become the number one ad company in the world. But, once they acquired a company, the brothers lost interest, often refusing to meet with its executives again. This disdain would come back to haunt them. Also chronicled is the brothers' rich lifestyle, which critics claim was funded by the company. This tale features a rich cast of supporting players: Jeremy Sinclair, a creative advertising genius who was fiercely loyal to the brothers, was one of the executives who resigned after Maurice was fired. Bill Muirhead, another loyalist, was responsible for keeping clients happy. Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a globe-trotting native of France, was brought in by the Saatchis in 1989 when the company was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Louis-Dreyfus brought in Charles Scott, a self-described numbers cruncher uncomfortable with the glitzy world of advertising, to help sort out the company's complex finances. And leading the anti-Maurice movement was David Herro, a thirty-three-year-old American money manager whose group owned approximately 10 percent of Saatchi stock. Built into the Saatchi story is the bigger picture of the dramatic changes in advertising in the 1980s, such as the merger mania and ad agency consolidations that swept Madison Avenue, including the British takeover of major agencies. The story of the decline and crash of Saatchi & Saatchi is a universal tale of corporate greed and ineffective management. It is the story of an ugly, publicly fought civil war in an industry that is supposed to know the steep price paid for an image run amok.",

                  "\"The chasm is where high-tech fortunes are lost... the tornado is where they are made.\"-- Steve Jobs, Founder & CEO, Next Computer, Inc.    Now, in this fascinating sequel, Moore shows how to capitalize on the profit-rich niches and hyper-growth markets beyond the chasm. Continuing to chart the impact of the Technology Adoption Life Cycle, he explores its effects not just on marketing but on overall business planning, especially strategic partnerships, competitive advantage, positioning and organizational leadership. Moore's most startling lesson is: \"As markets move from stage to stage in the Life Cycle, the winning strategy does not just change -- it actually reverses the prior strategy. The very skills that you've just perfected become your biggest liabilities; and if you can't put them aside to acquire new ones, then you're in for tough times.\" As challenging as this lesson is to apply, Moore leads the way. Using actual examples of cutting-edge firms, he applies the Life Cycle model to all aspects of managing a market-focused business strategy, including how to manage people effectively through each phase of the cycle. There are significant management implications: Chasm-crossers who love the customer intimacy of niches may rebel against the depersonalizing power of the tornado; tornado managers who relish the gales of hyper-growth may resist the inevitable return to the niche, in the guise of mass customization, once the rush to the new paradigm subsides. All industries relying on technology -- not just computer hardware, software and telecommunications, but entertainment, publishing, broadcasting, banking, insurance, health care, aerospace, defense, utilities, pharmaceuticals and retail -- must master Moore's lessons to see the year 2000. If you are marketing technology-based products or managing the people who do, then you will find yourself Inside the Tornado.",

                  "By Watson, John H. and Millett, Larry (EDT)",
                  "It is the story of how the world's most beloved private detective, Sherlock Holmes, and Watson traveled to Minnesota in 1894 to find and stop a murderous arsonist, known only as the Red Demon, who is threatening both Hill and his Great Northern Railway. Homes's pursuit of this malignant and cunning villain presents the great man \"with the most remarkable case of his celebrated career.\"In Minnesota, Holmes comes face-to-face with all manner of frontier characters, including two-fisted railroad men, rough-and-tumble lumberjacks, a one-eyed teamster, and an unsavory town marshal. But he also encounters the proprietress of the North Woods' most opulent sporting house, Mary Robinson, a woman as clever as she is beautiful. In response to a churlish remark from Dr. Watson about the morality of her establishment, she replies: \"Morality is a matter of power, nothing more and nothing less. The rich impose it on the poor, men impose it on women, and the forces of reaction impose it upon those who seek a better world.\"Needless to say, Holmes becomes especially attentive to this suspect's articulate charm. But charm gives way to terror in the exciting climax of the tale, a chase on the rails that ends with Holmes and the Red Demon squared off on a lonely bridge in a fiery circle of death. \"Never,\" says Watson, \"was Holmes more magnificent than at that moment.\"",

There, he becomes a fan of a G.I. stationed at the base, one Elvis Presley, whose music is played over and over on the radio. When Orson is caught stealing recordings of Elvis's tunes from the PX, the attendant publicity catches the star's attention, and he comes to visit his young fan. Thus begins a lifelong friendship. As Elvis's career rockets ever higher and his behavior becomes ever more erratic, the two share many adventures. The sixties explode, and Elvis becomes the icon of the nation, while Orson, a college demonstrator, drifts away from regular life while looking for something of substance to believe in. Each man is an emblem of his time, as social conventions crumble, barriers fall, and the cultural landscape changes forever.A panorama of change and dissent, of the ability of friends to stay true despite distance and time, Elvis in the Morning portrays a nation in change and the effects of celebrity on innocence.",

It offers a rare, unvarnished look inside the realm of international diplomacy. Owen describes the consequences of the Clinton Administration's opposition to the Vance-Owen peace plan. He recounts how other peace settlements were hindered by divisions between the United States, Europe, and Russia as well as the United Nations and NATO, and by the bad faith of warring leaders who believed they had more to gain through war than peace. Owen also gives an account of the NATO assault on Bosnian Serb positions and the latest attempts at reaching a settlement.Written with candor and reason, Balkan Odyssey is a day-to-day account of the traps and tangles of diplomacy and the enduring dangers of policy that is dictated by rhetoric instead of reality.

                  "Deadly germs sprayed in shopping malls, bomb-lets spewing anthrax spores over battlefields, tiny vials of plague scattered in Times Square -- these are the poor man's hydrogen bombs, hideous weapons of mass destruction that can be made in a simple laboratory. In this groundbreaking work of investigative journalism, Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg, and William Broad of The New York Times uncover the truth about biological weapons and show why bio-warfare and bio-terrorism are fast becoming our worst national nightmare.  Among the startling revelations in Germs:   How the CIA secretly built and tested a model of a Soviet-designed germ bomb, alarming some officials who felt the work pushed to the limits of what is permitted by the global treaty banning germ arms. How the Pentagon embarked on a secret effort to make a superbug. Details about the Soviet Union's massive hidden program to produce biological weapons, including new charges that germs were tested on humans. How Moscow's scientists made an untraceable germ that instructs the body to destroy itself. The Pentagon's chaotic efforts to improvise defenses against Iraq's biological weapons during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. How a religious cult in Oregon in the 1980s sickened hundreds of Americans in a bio-terrorism attack that the government played down to avoid panic and copycat strikes. Plans by the U.S. military in the 1960s to attack Cuba with germ weapons.   Germs also shows how a small group of scientists and senior officials persuaded President Bill Clinton to launch a controversial multibillion-dollar program to detect a germ attack on U.S. soil and to aid its victims -- a program that, so far, is struggling to provide real protection.  Based on hundreds of interviews with scientists and senior officials, including President Clinton, as well as on recently declassified documents and on-site reporting from the former Soviet Union's sinister bio-weapons labs, Germs shows us bio-warriors past and present at work at their trade. There is the American scientist who devoted his professional life to perfecting biological weapons, and the Nobel laureate who helped pioneer the new biology of genetically modified germs and is now trying to stop its misuse. We meet former Soviet scientists who made enough plague, smallpox, and anthrax to kill everyone on Earth and whose expertise is now in great demand by terrorists, rogue states, and legitimate research labs alike.  A frightening and unforgettable narrative of cutting-edge science and spycraft, Germs shows us why advances in biology and the spread of germ weapons expertise to such countries as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea could make germs the weapon of the twenty-first century.",

It is the story of Bragg's father, a hard-drinking man with a murderous temper and the habit of running out on the people who needed him most.But at the center of this soaring memoir is Bragg's mother, who went eighteen years without a new dress so that her sons could have school clothes and picked other people's cotton so that her children wouldn't have to live on welfare alone. Evoking these lives--and the country that shaped and nourished them--with artistry, honesty, and compassion, Rick Bragg brings home the love and suffering that lie at the heart of every family.

                  "As a top aide to powerful Texas Congressman Ronald Coleman, John Jackley watched the nation's highest elected officials lie, manipulate media images, and spend millions of taxpayer dollars to stay in power. The mind-boggling scope of the abuse of perks and privilege by both legislators and their staffers finally shocked him into reality.What began as a secret journal for his children to clear his conscience has become Hill Rat, a journey behind Congress' closed doors and into the corrupt back alleys of power. With both humor and outrage, Jackley reveals how the promise of Congress has been hijacked and corrupted by the current crop of careerist incumbents. \"Today,\" he writes, \"a successful congressman has the fundraising ability of a hooker trying to make cab fare home and the morals of a big-time football coach!\"His account is laced with the names of Capitol Hill's most prominent legislators--Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, Speaker of the House Thomas Foley, Ron Dellums, Bill Alexander, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, Thomas Luken, and scores of others. Jackley also reveals, with names, dates, and examples, the outrageous power of Congressional staffers--\"Hill Rats\"--who \"run the engines of democracy on a daily basis and pride themselves on their ability to do anything in the name of their cause.\"To show the flagrant abuse of taxpayers' money for re-election purposes, Jackley points out that in just forty-eight hours in early 1992, the House mailed more than 58 million newsletters and postcards. In 1990, the first post-Jim Wright, post-congressional scandal election, 96% of the incumbents who ran were reelected. Even in 1988, only six Members running for re-election were defeated, a turnover rate less than that of the Soviet Politburo.From previously untold Congressional involvement in Oliver North's contra re-supply network to Democratic complicity in the S&L crisis to the taxpayer-funded incumbent protection plan, Hill Rat reveals secrets backed by hard evidence that will shake the House and shock the nation.",

It changed my life - or almost did - and I think about it more than I should, but that was a long time ago.Amid the breathtaking beauty of the Catskill Mountains, Avrum Feldman listened to the haunting voice of Amelita Galli-Curci ringing over the Shandaken Valley - a voice no one else could hear. When he died at age one hundred six, his obsession for the famous opera diva had lasted three-quarters of a century. Most people considered Avrum crazy, someone preoccupied with romantic nonsense. But Madison Lee \"Bobo\" Murphy was not among them, for he, too, had a love that changed his life, or almost did: Amy Lourie.In the summer of 1955, Bobo was a waiter at the Catskill's Pine Hill Inn; a rural Southerner who had never heard the word meshugge until Avrum - a retired furrier, teacher, and translator from New York City - became his unlikely friend. For Bobo nothing about that summer ever lost its glow: his first taste of kartoffel suppe; the exotic mingling of Yiddish and German in the dining room; the girl he met and loved....In everyone's life, Avrum had instructed, there is one grand, undeniable moment of change that never stops mattering. It came for Bobo in his first meeting with Amy, the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. He was too naive to comprehend the gulf between their worlds, and she was too smitten by him to care. But for a wealthy Jewish girl and a Georgia farm boy, the summer had to end, leaving Bobo to learn the painful lesson of loving someone and believing you cannot be with them.Now, thirty-eight years later, Avrum is gone, leaving a will that beckons Bobo north to the Catskills once more. In the places he'd walked so often on the paths of memory, he embraces the ghosts of old friendships and the haunting hints of Amy's presence, until she unexpectedly appears. Nothing has dimmed the passion of their youth, yet two lifetimes and a thousand Catskills sunsets stand between who they were and who they have become. The strikes against them are different now, but mysteriously, miraculously, as Bobo carries out Avrum's last wishes for a strange Kaddish, he hears the dreams of his youth, of the young man who went forth and became part of a love larger than himself....",

                  "For the first time ever, veteran World War II cryptographer Hervie Haufler details how American and British codebreakers were the decisive factor in the Allied victory. From the Purple Machine to the Navajo Talkers to the breaking of Japan's JN-25 Naval Code to the shadowy world of decoding units like Hut-8 in Bletchley Park, he shows how crucial information-often obtained by surreptitious and violent means-was the decisive edge in the Battle of Britain, at Midway and against the U-Boats in the North Atlantic, and how Allied intelligence saved the Soviet Union from almost certain defeat.  In an accessible account based on years of research, interviews and exclusive access to previously top-secret archives, Haufler demonstrates how cryptography enabled Nimitz and MacArthur to persevere in the Pacific and helped Eisenhower and Patton mount the assaults on Normandy. In compelling detail, Haufler shows us how it was done-as only one who was on the frontlines of the \"secret war\" could tell it.",

How Good Do We Have to Be? is for everyone who experiences that sense of guilt and disappointment. Harold Kushner, writing with his customary generosity and wisdom, shows us how human life is too complex for anyone to live it without making mistakes, and why we need not fear the loss of God's love when we are less than perfect. Harold Kushner begins by offering a radically new interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve, which he sees as a tale of Paradise Outgrown rather than Paradise Lost: eating from the Tree of Knowledge was not an act of disobedience, but a brave step forward toward becoming human, complete with the richness of work, sexuality and child-rearing, and a sense of our mortality. Drawing on modern literature, psychology, theology,,and his own thirty years of experience as a congregational rabbi, Harold Kushner reveals how acceptance and forgiveness can change our relationships with the most important people in our lives and help us meet the bold and rewarding challenge of being human.",

The same biting wit, fragile irony, and arresting candor of Sandra's performances are all here, but Love Love and Love is also filled with an intimacy and an insight that are all new... and all Bernhard.Here are the stories of a relationship built on the weapon of romance; of an elusive girl, and the various drugs she gives and takes; of dreams and daydreams that melt into truth; of the touch of a lover's skin at the break of dawn; and of all the pain and cruelty that go along so well with the ecstasy we all want to possess. This is a book about relationships born of chance meetings on the street at night; about sexual obsessions, frayed emotions, and haunting memories of both the quick and the dead. Love Love and Love is by turns shocking and exhilarating, angry and passionate, analytical and sexy; it's all about that strange state of being that merges sensations only of the moment with an emotion that has existed since the birth of humankind.As Sandra herself notes: \"Love is the only shocking act left on the face of the earth.\"",

                  "['Goldman, Kevin']",
                  "On December 16, 1994, a bloodletting took place in the stylish sixth-floor boardroom at Saatchi & Saatchi Company PLC, once the world's largest advertising agency holding company. Maurice Saatchi, the 48 year-old chairman who co-founded the company in 1970 with his older brother Charles, was fired by the board of directors under threat by the firm's largest shareholders. Less than a month later, Maurice started a rival ad agency and quickly snapped up former Saatchi & Saatchi clients, most importantly British Airways. Kevin Goldman, the former daily advertising columnist for the Wall Street Journal, spoke to everyone connected with this headline-making saga -- including Maurice Saatchi and his reclusive brother Charles -- and witnessed important business meetings, including Maurice Saatchi's winning pitch to British Airways. Goldman traces every step the Saatchi brothers took, from their youth as Iraqi Jewish immigrants in North London to their business merger in 1970, when, with little more than sheer audacity, the opened an ad agency with a full-page announcement ad in the London Sunday Times. Through bold and brash actions, the agency began an acquisitions binge, taking over many of the ad industry's giants -- including Ted Bates, Backer & Spielvogel, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, and Garland-Compton -- to become the number one ad company in the world. But, once they acquired a company, the brothers lost interest, often refusing to meet with its executives again. This disdain would come back to haunt them. Also chronicled is the brothers' rich lifestyle, which critics claim was funded by the company. This tale features a rich cast of supporting players: Jeremy Sinclair, a creative advertising genius who was fiercely loyal to the brothers, was one of the executives who resigned after Maurice was fired. Bill Muirhead, another loyalist, was responsible for keeping clients happy. Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a globe-trotting native of France, was brought in by the Saatchis in 1989 when the company was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Louis-Dreyfus brought in Charles Scott, a self-described numbers cruncher uncomfortable with the glitzy world of advertising, to help sort out the company's complex finances. And leading the anti-Maurice movement was David Herro, a thirty-three-year-old American money manager whose group owned approximately 10 percent of Saatchi stock. Built into the Saatchi story is the bigger picture of the dramatic changes in advertising in the 1980s, such as the merger mania and ad agency consolidations that swept Madison Avenue, including the British takeover of major agencies. The story of the decline and crash of Saatchi & Saatchi is a universal tale of corporate greed and ineffective management. It is the story of an ugly, publicly fought civil war in an industry that is supposed to know the steep price paid for an image run amok.",

Now, in this fascinating sequel, Moore shows how to capitalize on the profit-rich niches and hyper-growth markets beyond the chasm. Continuing to chart the impact of the Technology Adoption Life Cycle, he explores its effects not just on marketing but on overall business planning, especially strategic partnerships, competitive advantage, positioning and organizational leadership. Moore's most startling lesson is: \"As markets move from stage to stage in the Life Cycle, the winning strategy does not just change -- it actually reverses the prior strategy. The very skills that you've just perfected become your biggest liabilities; and if you can't put them aside to acquire new ones, then you're in for tough times.\" As challenging as this lesson is to apply, Moore leads the way. Using actual examples of cutting-edge firms, he applies the Life Cycle model to all aspects of managing a market-focused business strategy, including how to manage people effectively through each phase of the cycle. There are significant management implications: Chasm-crossers who love the customer intimacy of niches may rebel against the depersonalizing power of the tornado; tornado managers who relish the gales of hyper-growth may resist the inevitable return to the niche, in the guise of mass customization, once the rush to the new paradigm subsides.

Homes's pursuit of this malignant and cunning villain presents the great man \"with the most remarkable case of his celebrated career.\"In Minnesota, Holmes comes face-to-face with all manner of frontier characters, including two-fisted railroad men, rough-and-tumble lumberjacks, a one-eyed teamster, and an unsavory town marshal. But he also encounters the proprietress of the North Woods' most opulent sporting house, Mary Robinson, a woman as clever as she is beautiful. In response to a churlish remark from Dr. Watson about the morality of her establishment, she replies: \"Morality is a matter of power, nothing more and nothing less. The rich impose it on the poor, men impose it on women, and the forces of reaction impose it upon those who seek a better world.\"Needless to say, Holmes becomes especially attentive to this suspect's articulate charm. But charm gives way to terror in the exciting climax of the tale, a chase on the rails that ends with Holmes and the Red Demon squared off on a lonely bridge in a fiery circle of death. \"Never,\" says Watson, \"was Holmes more magnificent than at that moment.\"",

There, he becomes a fan of a G.I. stationed at the base, one Elvis Presley, whose music is played over and over on the radio. When Orson is caught stealing recordings of Elvis's tunes from the PX, the attendant publicity catches the star's attention, and he comes to visit his young fan. Thus begins a lifelong friendship. As Elvis's career rockets ever higher and his behavior becomes ever more erratic, the two share many adventures. The sixties explode, and Elvis becomes the icon of the nation, while Orson, a college demonstrator, drifts away from regular life while looking for something of substance to believe in. Each man is an emblem of his time, as social conventions crumble, barriers fall, and the cultural landscape changes forever.A panorama of change and dissent, of the ability of friends to stay true despite distance and time, Elvis in the Morning portrays a nation in change and the effects of celebrity on innocence.",

It offers a rare, unvarnished look inside the realm of international diplomacy. Owen describes the consequences of the Clinton Administration's opposition to the Vance-Owen peace plan. He recounts how other peace settlements were hindered by divisions between the United States, Europe, and Russia as well as the United Nations and NATO, and by the bad faith of warring leaders who believed they had more to gain through war than peace. Owen also gives an account of the NATO assault on Bosnian Serb positions and the latest attempts at reaching a settlement.Written with candor and reason, Balkan Odyssey is a day-to-day account of the traps and tangles of diplomacy and the enduring dangers of policy that is dictated by rhetoric instead of reality.

Por cientos de a\\u00f1os, abuelitas y madres han tratado una  gran variedad de afecciones con alimentos tan sencillos como al ajo, la  miel, las papas ya los tomates (jitomates). Estas curas caseras latinas nos intrigaron, y por tanto nosotros, los editores de la renombrada revista de salud Prevention, empezamos a investigar los alimentos t\\u00edpicos de Latinoam\\u00e9rica en busca de m\\u00e1s remedios naturales.  Y lo que encontramos fue realmente asombroso:  20 alimentos que sirven  para prevenir o tratar 63 males, desde problemas comunes como cardenales  y dolor de est\\u00f3mago a enfermedades serias como c\\u00e1ncer, enfermedades  card\\u00edacas y derrames cerebrales. Adem\\u00e1s, descubrimos m\\u00e1s de 100  alimentos que tratan o protegen contra las afecciones que m\\u00e1s afectan a  los latinos, entre ellos asma, colesterol alto, diabetes, presi\\u00f3n alta,  sobrepeso y \\u00falceras. Y estas \\\"medicinas\\\" no s\\u00f3lo son econ\\u00f3micas y  f\\u00e1ciles de conseguir, sino tambi\\u00e9n son riqu\\u00edsimas y por lo general no  tienen efectos secundarios. Lo mejor de todo es que las recomendaciones de Curas de la cocina latina  son todas aprobadas por m\\u00e9dicos, nutri\\u00f3logos e investigadores de la  nutrici\\u00f3n del mundo entero. Nosotros los entrevistamos y adem\\u00e1s  revisamos estudios realizados sobre los alimentos latinos por m\\u00e1s de un  a\\u00f1o, editando el texto cuidadosamente para brindarle s\\u00f3lo las comidas  m\\u00e1s efectivas y sabrosas.
